<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<b>The fourth Progress in Colour Studies conference will take place at University College London, UK, from Wednesday 14 September to Friday 16 September 2016.
</b>
<br>

As with previous conferences in the PICS series, the aim is to provide a multidisciplinary forum for discussion of recent and ongoing research, presented so as to be accessible to scholars in other disciplines. We therefore welcome proposals for papers on colour studies from any area of interest, including but not limited to the following topics: 
<ul>
<li>linguistics, psycholinguistics</li>
<li>vision, perception, cognition, memory</li>
<li>design, fashion</li>
<li>architecture, art, history, heritage, culture</li>
<li>imaging, computation, analysis, modelling</li>
<li>illumination, optics, photography, technology</li>
<li>conservation, chemistry, materials, surfaces</li>
</ul>
<br>
Authors are also encouraged to consider their own specialist colour expertise in the broader context of colour at the intersection of many disciplines.
<br>
Along with three keynote speakers (tbc), the conference will include a single track of oral presentations (ca. 33) and up to three poster sessions / demonstrations. Oral presentations will be allocated 25 minutes per speaker (15 minutes for the presentation plus 10 minutes for discussion). Proposals for poster sessions and group sessions (of 3-5 papers) are also welcome. There will be a prize for the best poster.
<br>
Abstracts for proposed papers are limited to two pages, up to 1000 words, including references and figures. Each abstract should consist of a cover sheet with the name and contact details of the author(s) and two separate sheets without identification containing the abstract. The abstracts should be submitted via EasyChair, PICS2016 website, by 31st January 2016.
<br>
Abstracts will be double-blind peer-reviewed. Notification of acceptance will follow by 30th April 2016. Shortly before the conference the Book of abstracts will be available for download from PICS2016 website.
<br>
The conference fee will be GBP180, with a reduced rate for students, undergraduate and postgraduate, and the unwaged. We regret that we cannot offer any scholarships or other contributions to expenses.
A wide range of University and hotel accommodation will be available. Details of how to book will be posted on our website shortly.
